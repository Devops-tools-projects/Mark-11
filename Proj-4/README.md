# Introduction to AI & Prompt engineering

## Prompt Engineering

it is the practice of designing and refining inputs(prompts) given to AI model to get accurate, useful and consistent outputs. A good prompt not only provide better results but also significantly reduce the cost for the organisation. as Bad prompts will use more API Tokens to generate a solution.

### Types of Prompting

1)**Zero shot Prompting** :  it is when we provide a prompt to the model with no prior example. it is when we expect the model to alredy know the answer.

	EX: "Translate this into french: I Love Linux"

2)**Few Shot Prompting** : It is when we provide a prompt with few example before asking the model to perform the task.

	EX: create a random name which starts with B, like Batman

3)**Multi Shot Prompting** : It is similar to few short, but with many example, it is larger training like prompt.

4)**Chain of Thought(COT) Prompting** : Asking the model to reason step-by-step before giving the final answer. mostly used for logical, math, (or) reasoning problems.


- Things to consider while providing a prompt are

	1)context

	2)instruction

	3)examples

	4)output format
