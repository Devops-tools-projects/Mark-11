### Project: **CI/CD Pipeline for a Microservices Application with AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform**

#### 1. **Project Overview:**
Create a pipeline that automates the deployment of a containerized microservices application to AWS. This will involve using **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning, **Docker** for containerization, **Kubernetes** for orchestration, **Jenkins** for CI/CD, and **Ansible** for configuration management. The application should be split into multiple services (e.g., frontend, backend, and database).

#### 2. **Key Objectives:**
- Provision infrastructure in AWS using Terraform.
- Build Docker images for each service.
- Store Docker images in AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry).
- Deploy and manage the containerized services in **Kubernetes** (EKS - Elastic Kubernetes Service).
- Automate the process using **Jenkins**.
- Use **Ansible** to manage configurations.
- Monitor logs and alerts for the system.

### 3. **Steps to Complete the Project:**

#### **Step 1: Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform**
- Use Terraform to provision the following resources on AWS:
  - EC2 Instances (for Jenkins and other services).
  - IAM roles and policies.
  - VPC, Subnets, and Security Groups for networking.
  - ECR (Elastic Container Registry) for Docker images.
  - EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for running the Kubernetes cluster.
  - S3 buckets for storing logs or configuration files.

#### **Step 2: Dockerize the Application**
- Create a multi-container microservices application (e.g., a simple "To-Do List" app with a frontend, backend, and database).
- Create Dockerfiles for each component of the application.
- Build Docker images and push them to AWS ECR.

#### **Step 3: Kubernetes Deployment**
- Configure **EKS** with **kubectl** to interact with the cluster.
- Write Kubernetes deployment YAML files for each service.
  - Deployment for frontend, backend, and database.
  - Services to expose the containers to the internet.
  - ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration management.
- Use **Helm** charts for easier management and versioning of Kubernetes deployments.

#### **Step 4: Continuous Integration with Jenkins**
- Set up Jenkins with the following:
  - Use a Jenkinsfile for pipeline automation (version control with GitHub).
  - Jenkins will clone the application from GitHub, build Docker images, push to ECR, and deploy to EKS.
  - Add integration tests to validate the deployed application.
  - Configure Jenkins with **AWS credentials** for access to AWS services (ECR, EKS).

#### **Step 5: Configuration Management with Ansible**
- Use **Ansible** to automate the configuration of your EC2 instances, such as setting up the necessary software packages or configurations for Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes.

#### **Step 6: Git and GitHub Integration**
- Use **Git** for version control.
- Store all your code (Dockerfiles, Kubernetes configurations, Jenkinsfiles, Ansible playbooks) in **GitHub**.
- Set up webhooks from GitHub to trigger Jenkins jobs upon code pushes or pull requests.

#### **Step 7: Automation with Shell Scripts**
- Write **Shell Scripts** to automate the provisioning and setup process:
  - Shell scripts for environment setup.
  - Scripts for managing Docker containers locally before pushing to AWS.

#### **Step 8: Monitoring and Logging**
- Set up **CloudWatch** for logging and monitoring of AWS resources.
- Use **Prometheus** and **Grafana** (or AWS CloudWatch metrics) for monitoring Kubernetes clusters and application performance.
- Integrate **alerts** for failures or performance bottlenecks.

### 4. **Skills Demonstrated:**
- **Unix**: Handling server administration and file management tasks.
- **AWS (EC2, Lambda, IAM, S3)**: Provisioning cloud resources and managing security.
- **Shell Scripting**: Automating tasks and processes.
- **Ansible**: Configuring EC2 instances and Kubernetes.
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control for infrastructure and application code.
- **Jenkins**: Automating the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code for AWS resources.
- **Docker**: Containerizing microservices.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrating and scaling containerized applications.

### 5. **Additional Enhancements (Optional)**
- Implement **canary deployments** or **blue-green deployments** using Kubernetes for minimal downtime.
- Integrate **Slack notifications** or other messaging systems with Jenkins for build and deployment status updates.
- Set up **auto-scaling** in Kubernetes based on resource utilization.
